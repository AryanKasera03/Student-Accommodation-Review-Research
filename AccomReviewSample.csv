0,iQ Weaver Place,IQ weaver place has been an amazing place to reside in while at uni. Moved here in September and spent most of lockdown within my flat space. Amazing on site staff who are always ready and enthusiastic to provide any type of assistance required. Would definitely recommend staying here for uni students looking to book accommodation!
1,Julian Court,"I am living in classic studio with a window facing to south. The space and decroations of room are decent. There are some features that I quite like.
1.The living space is pretty quiet. There is no worry about noise in any time.
2.The receptionist is quite kind. And they will quickly inform you, if your amaz package is reached.
3.There are some small gifts or candies during festivals.
4.There are two stores near the accomadation. And it takes about 10-min walk to the shopping centre.
Basically, if you enjoy a quiet life during your study, that is definately one of best places you want to choose in coventry."
2,Julian Court,"I have a very nice experience staying in Julian Court! All the rooms are studios. The residence is in a quite area so no worry about notices outside. Also to go to University of Warwick only takes about 20 minutes in total. The staff here are really friendly and helpful. They can help you with anything, from local life to living experience. I‚Äôll definitely recommend it to those who wish to have a private space to stay."
3,Julian Court,"As a self-contained studio apartment, Julian Court has all the functions I need to live securely and safely under Covid-19 pandemic. And the reception service here is really warm and welcoming."
4,Julian Court,"I like the young lady in reception, she is always enthusiasm when I pick the package"
5,Julian Court,"Comfortable, convenient position, good service. An enjoybale living experience. It is suitable for various students."
6,Julian Court,"I love my room, especially the two big windows, from which I can see beautiful sceneries. The furniture inside the room is great and convenient to use. Besides, the administrator at the reception is very enthusiastic and kind. Really enjoying living there!"
7,Market Way,"I have lived here for more than 4 years and my overall experience with Study Inn is absolutely amazing. It has THE best arrangements, management and staff and I love how considerate everyone is. Gonna miss it badly once I am gone!"
8,Market Way,Very helpful and co-operative staff. Always ready to assist the residents and take measures to keep us safe.
9,Market Way,Nice atmosphere. Staffs are very friendly and ready to help. Need to improve the wifi.
10,Market Way,"If you want to live in an accomondation in the heart of the city centre then this is your place!! The room is excellent with all the necessary tools to live so there is no need to buy anything!! Toilet is good but a bit small!! Heating during the winter is great and can keep u warm!! The desk for you to study is large, with enough space to put your books and computer!! The staff is friendly, kind (especially the manager of the building and always ready to help even during the night!! The only thing that needs an update is the social spaces(more games, spaces to play and engage with each other etc) in the accomondation and more social events in order for all of us to get to know each other!!Finally, since the building is in the city centre you can confortably explore the city's day and night (social) life with a nice selection of cafes, restaurants and bars (all of them are very close from the accomondation on foot)"
11,Market Way,Fine for location.Rooms are spacious but toilets are dated.Staff are there all the time and everything is ready to stay so no need to buy anything
12,Urban Student Village,"I‚Äôve never seen a property that clean and cosy.
Thanks to Dorota for helping me even when she doesn‚Äôt work. She‚Äôs always available."
13,Urban Student Village,"I loved ringway house as soon as i had my viewing, the space, the location and especially the management (Dorota and sarah) who have been wonderful"
14,Urban Student Village,"Ringway House is located in a really convenient location, close to bus stops to get to uni and the city centre for all your shopping needs. My studio is spacious and I have an amazing view of the city. The property team is lovely and friendly as well."
15,Urban Student Village,"Lovely management with lovely management, would highly recommend, it‚Äôs the little things that count and they‚Äôre always working around the clock. Nice rooms also very good value for money"
16,Urban Student Village,"Great staff for the most part, but very unpleasant stay. Constant, CONSTANT issues with water, heating, plumbing, general falling apart of the room, lighting, only a couple of weeks after I moved in. Higher management didn‚Äôt seem to care about the issues I and plenty other residents had/still have. Staff didn‚Äôt tell me when a repair I had was due and entered my room while I was out which is very concerning and an invasion of privacy and didn‚Äôt say anything when I said as much - again didn‚Äôt seem to care. Some tenants very rude and disrespectful without cause - touching my clothes, verbal abuse, staff were aware and didn‚Äôt care, overall awful stay I would highly recommend avoiding this place for your stay, as I have said to every other Uni student I know here out of genuine concern for them."
17,Urban Student Village,I love this place been a blast since I moved in September and it‚Äôs only gone better as my journey continues with ringway house. Will definitely recommend this to any student without a shadow of a doubt and love to thank the management team (Dorota) for making my stay so pleasantt
18,Abbey House,"It is an absolutely great place with highest Covid-19 tailored standards. The receptionist and house manager Hedy is very friendly and is keen to always help residents out with any issues. A great gym facility on the ground floor and spacious study areas with large TV facilities for working on Your Uni presentation, when a your room environment is too familiar and demotivating. The location is also 1 min away from Coventry station which is 40 mins away from London Euston‚Äôs station to enjoy London vibes every weekends. Great value for money üí∞ and top service quality."
19,Abbey House,"Amazing accommodation, I love the gym and room is very clear and bright, especially, the staffs are very friendly!"
20,Abbey House,It's actually a nice locationÔºånear the rail station and bus stop. The facilities are all great. The service from reception staffs are great. They are all nice people and glad to help us.
21,Abbey House,"Good location that next to the Coventry railway and bus station, suitable for Coventry or Warwick Uni student. Clean room and corridor. They have enough social facilities, like gym room, study room, even study area in the lobby."
22,Mercia Lodge,"Mercia lodge is conveniently located at the center with ease of access to all I need as a student: it‚Äôs like a 5 - 7 minute walk from Coventry University, 1 - 5 minute walk from shopping malls, fast food joints, restaurants, and more. The management team provide a great customer service, they are nice, easy to talk to and understanding. In short it‚Äôs an outstanding and low key place."
23,Mercia Lodge,"Staying in Mercia Lodge was an overall enjoyable experience for me, but it has its issues. It's in a great location only a few minutes to get to the shops or uni and its right across the street from Wetherspoons. Its got a free on site gym and cinema room which always appeared to be well kept, as well as a table tennis and pool table (which isn't level) in the social areas. There is also an on site laundry room, but it will cost about a 5er to do a load of washing and drying which you have to pay for using an app.
The rooms do come with a kitchen (small fridge, ceramic hob, small sink, and a small microwave combi oven), but they aren't particularly useable and my sink was in a state of being perpetually clogged. The issues really start to become apparent if or when something brakes or you need something from maintenance, as it takes a while for any action to be taken. Also worth noting that while I was there, one of the lifts occasionally worked, but was temperamental at best."
24,Mercia Lodge,"Mercia Lodge located in a very good place. The surrounding public security is good, shopping is convenient. The staff group is friendly and efficient. The room configuration is also good, cost-effective"
25,Mercia Lodge,"amazing experience, kept clean and very safe. Good social life and great location"
26,Mercia Lodge,"Location is excellent loads of essential stores nearby, room is very spacious so is the gym and worth the price. Staff is very friendly and welcoming."
27,Mercia Lodge,"Mercia Lodge is a really good place to stay at while doing your degree. The accommodation held a lot of social events which allows you to meet new people. The people living in this building are also very friendly if you try to get to know them. The location is perfect, as it is located in the city centre. The facilities are also great. You can gather with your friends and watch in the cinema room or socialise in the social place. The staff of Mercia is also friendly and very helpful, and the building is always clean. Everytime it gets a bit dirty, the staff will clean it right away. The price is also very reasonable and worth it. Definitely recommended for people to stay at!"
28,City Point,Really recommand City PointÔºÅIt has a perfect location and you can get whatever you want from the Coventry city centre. The environment of the apartments are peaceful and tidy. The reception and security here are responsible and friendly for any queries.
29,City Point,"Very good commendation. I would highly recommend City Point to those who are planing to study in Coventry and Warwick. The location of CP is perfect, it takes about 3 mins to get to the Coventry city centre where I can get anything I want. The reception and security of CP are really friendly and helpfulÔºÅReally good choiceÔºÅ"
30,City Point,"Love staying in City Point! Living in City Point has really lightened my student life in Coventry. The ensuite room is comfortable, the flat common area is large. We have 5 people in the flat, and the common room suits our need for cooking and leisure. Besides, the reception staffs are helpful and caring. Very recommend to students!"
31,Gulson Gardens,"Brilliant building, great facilities, and the management team complete this place. Vicky and Andy are absolutely brilliant!"
32,Gulson Gardens,I was quite apprehensive about moving out at first but the team here made everything easy for me. Gulson Gardens is now home. I love it here
33,Gulson Gardens,"I was quite nervous moving back into student halls again after some bad experiences, but my time here has been amazing so far!
Everyone who works here is super welcoming and friendly. They really put in an effort to grt to know us all and in arranging social events. Everything is so well maintained, extremely secure, and we have some lovely social spaces here too which means that those of us who want to sleep will get some rest, and anyone who wants to stay up late have a space to do that rather than disturbing flatmates.
Would 100% recommend for anyone looking for a place to stay."
34,Gulson Gardens,"Cannot honestly recommend this place enough. This place has helped me in more ways than just providing accommodation, the social spaces are like no other. The sense of community and welcome you get here you won‚Äôt find anywhere else! 2 min walk to main campuses and the management team are so friendly and helpful. And the rooms are so nice!"
35,Canvas Coventry,The facilities are very clean and the rooms are spacious. This space allows for studying as well as relaxing.
36,Paradise Student Village,Best accommodation I have been too
37,Paradise Student Village,"During lockdown, students were forced to pay full rent with no discount. Most student accommodations in the UK did however AXO would not allow it. That is the biggest complain"
38,Paradise Student Village,"Most of the experience is quite good. However, there is no any opening windows in my room. So there are no any fresh air inside. This affects my mental health."
39,Paradise Student Village,"Good management and security on site. Bikes are not covered in the insurance policy, so be careful, mine was stolen. Poor wifi (Always under maintenance). All round a good experience living here, but would recommend living in a flat with friends, to avoid uncomfortable living situations with random flat mates. Would recommend for first year students, definitely not for postgraduate students."
40,Paradise Student Village,"The only good thing about the Paradise Village is descent location, the rest is not even worth describing"
41,Merlin Point,Location is super goodÔºåjust between library and doctoral college.
42,Merlin Point,It was a nice experience
43,Apollo House,Excellent place to live/study
44,Apollo House,"The great location for my first year, my room is nice and staff are always friendly when I come in"
45,Apollo House,"Great value for money, and the property manager's are very nice and helpful."
46,Apollo House,the staff are warm-hearted and the room is very nice.all my trouble have been solved
47,Apollo House,Cheap and cheerful. The building has its flaws and it‚Äôs quite an old fashioned building. However it balances out with the cheaper price you pay compared to some of the overpriced student accommodations in Coventry
48,Gulson Gardens,"Brilliant building, great facilities, and the management team complete this place. Vicky and Andy are absolutely brilliant!"
